This is a simple go project to host wa websuite.
The Project is in first place about learning stuff. 
I restarted from the beginning, in order to incorporate Clean Code advice from the Book Clean Code from Robert C. Martins into it.Â£

Secondly i try to make the project in a way, that i start with a workjing website fast, and then expand on it over time. (Instead of letting the project die in perfection.)
