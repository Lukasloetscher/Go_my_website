            <h2>SIGA</h2>
            <div class="row">September 2022 – Present</div>

            <p>
                I first joined <a href="https://www.siga.swiss/ch_de" target="_blank">SIGA</a> as a trainee in digitalization and software development. I spent approximately six months with three different teams, learning about their responsibilities and contributing to their goals.
            </p>

            <p>
                After the trainee program, I transitioned to the Digital Supply Chain (DSC) team, where I still work today. SIGA is a medium-sized international company that produces high-performance sealing solutions for energy-efficient buildings. All products are manufactured in Switzerland, making operational efficiency critical for global competitiveness.
            </p>

            <p>
                SIGA embraces the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System" target="_blank">Toyota Production System</a> philosophy, which includes a continuous improvement cycle. Every ten working days, teams implement improvements based on daily suggestions. Although this system originated in manufacturing, SIGA applies it company-wide.
            </p>

            <p>
                In our team, I used these improvement cycles to increase system reliability by introducing a test environment, Git version control, and a structured release process using pull requests. I now focus on promoting Clean Code practices across the team.

                    <h2>First Stage – IT Infrastructure</h2>
                    <p>
                        My responsibilities ranged from first- and second-level support to maintaining the network and server infrastructure, as well as integrating new third-party tools. I regularly worked at the helpdesk, solving user issues directly and improving systems behind the scenes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On my initiative, I created a Python script to manage helpdesk scheduling and another for analyzing login logs to detect anomalies. This phase helped me fill knowledge gaps in server and network management and introduced me to Azure, especially its user administration features.
                    </p>

                <div class="container_with_background">
                    <h2>Second Stage – Digital Supply Chain (DSC)</h2>
                    <p>
                        The DSC team supports production and related departments (like maintenance, quality control, and materials management) and acts as a bridge to digitalization. We work in two-week sprints using Scrum and maintain close ties with production, including working on-site and collecting feedback during releases.
                    </p>

                    <p>During this stage, I worked on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Production Data Collection & Visualization:</strong>
                            <p>Connected machines to Azure to enable real-time data collection for internal stakeholders and ad-hoc analysis.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE):</strong>
                            <p>Calculated metrics like scrap, downtime, and machine output based on production data.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Reporting to SAP:</strong>
                            <p>Sent performance data to SAP for inventory tracking and product metadata management.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Traceability:</strong>
                            <p>Developed PowerApps-based solutions to track product history while minimizing disruptions to production.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Pull System:</strong>
                            <p>Built a system for signal transmission between machines. Initially based on Raspberry Pi, it was later migrated to PowerApps for better stability and maintainability.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Tools and technologies included SQL, Azure Data Factory, Azure Logic Apps, Power BI, PowerApps, Power Automate, and Linux systems. I provided support on all levels (first, second, and third).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Beside the normal duties in the DSC Team, I also used the "improvement days"  to introduce testing and  Version Control to the Team-

                    <h2>Third Stage – SAP Team</h2>
                    <p>
                        The SAP team focuses on customizing and extending SAP through custom applications. While work here was often individual, collaboration and knowledge sharing remained essential. This stage was slightly shortened so I could return to the DSC team to fill a vacant role.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I began by debugging existing code to understand the ABAP language and SAP structure, while still delivering stakeholder value. I also developed small tools and reports that improved usability and introduced error notifications.
                    </p>

                    <p>I also created scalable ABAP code to process inputs from logistics partners, complete delivery processes in SAP, and send confirmation emails to customers. It was designed to be easily extended for additional partners and included persistent data logging for state reporting.</p>

                    <p>
                        In addition, I mapped and reviewed all SAP code used by the DSC team. This helped resolve multiple misunderstandings between the two teams and strengthened our integration. This also is a big help in my current work back at DSC.

            <p>After the trainee program, I rejoined the DSC team as a full developer.</p>

                    My responsibilities are largely similar to those from my time as a trainee in the DSC team. I also kept pushing to improve the Code quality in the team:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improved SAP integration using knowledge from the SAP team</li>
                    <li>Implemented a structured release workflow using Git and pull requests as well asRelease Pipelines.</li>
                    <li>Encouraged Clean Code practices within the team</li>
                    <li>Started a discussion about how the core of the codebase is structured as well as providing recommendations on how to solve the current issues.
                </ul>
