                <p>If this page is being considered as part of a job application, I would like to let you know that I  am open to learning a new programming language between contract signing and my start date. in this case I would aim to reach a level where I can work independently with the language and a suitable IDE.</p>

        <div class="container_with_background">
            <h2>Soft Skills</h2>
            <p>I approach team discussions with a solution-oriented mindset and consider stakeholder perspectives when designing solutions. I maintain a high-level view of ongoing projects and voice concerns when I identify potential issues.</p>
            <p>Languages: German (native) and English (fluent, used throughout my Bachelor's and Master's studies, though I do not hold a formal certificate).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container_with_background">
            <h2>Current Learning</h2>
            <p>Even though I’ve completed my formal education, I remain committed to learning. My primary sources are books, but I also use online resources like <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Udemy</a>, YouTube, blogs, and official documentation. Whenever possible, I enjoy discussing these topics with others to deepen my understanding.</p>
            <p>I prefer understanding concepts over just following tutorials. For example, while transitioning this site from HTTP to HTTPS using Go, I researched the underlying protocol instead of simply copying tutorial code. A helpful resource was this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9QmMEWmcfo&t=125s&ab_channel=ByteByteGo" target="_blank">video</a>.</p>
            <p>When time doesn’t allow for in-depth exploration (as for example during work), I make a note to revisit the topic later.</p>

                <h2>Books</h2>
                <h3>Read</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        "Der Toyota Weg" by Jeffrey K. Liker (ISBN: 978-3-95972-473-9)<br>
                        This book explains Toyota’s approach to company organization. We read it in a work reading circle and discussed how our company aligns with or differs from its principles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin (ISBN: 978-3-8266-5548-7)<br>
                        Frustrated with messy code (both mine and others'), I read this book to improve. I’ve applied its principles to personal and work projects, sparking productive discussions with colleagues.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "OCP Java SE 21 Developer Study Guide" (ISBN: 978-1-394-28661-4)<br>
                        I read this to prepare for the Java certification exam (which I passed). It helped me fill in many technical gaps from earlier, informal learning.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Currently Reading</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        "Head First Design Patterns, 2nd Edition" (ISBN: 978-1-492-07800-5)<br>
                        Although I like the concepts, the style isn’t for me. So i dropped the book and started reading a more technical alternative instead.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" (ISBN: 978-0-201-63361-0)<br>
                        The more technical alternative to the head first book i picked up instead.
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Upcoming Reading List</h3>
