                        actually oneof the most important skills, not only for personal growth,
                        but also in order to have constructive discussion about ongoing projects.

                <p>Also if you read this, in relation with an application, i'm principle open to learn one programming
                    language in the time between signing the contract and the beginning of my work at your company. With
                    learning a language means, that i know the language, as well as an IDE to an extend, that i can do
                    the assigned tasks without being hindered by missing knowledge of the language.</p>

                <p>I work with Docker, both using docker files from repositories, as well as writing my own (for example
                    for hosting this site). In order to use those, i also know my way around linux operating systems.
